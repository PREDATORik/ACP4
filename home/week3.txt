1. Write classes that will save object(primitive fields or String) into file using
    a) Default Java Serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream) http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_serialization.htm
    b) Reflection
        file example

            ua.artcode.week1.Employee
            name=Andriy
            salary=2000
            age=25

    .For reading from file use Scanner and for write - PrintWriter

    * Add possibility to save and load several objects(Collection)
    * Hierarchy and recursively saving and loading

2. Do all unfinished tasks, do commits and push to GitHub

3. Write class Timer, that performs some action in defined period of time
   - start(long delay, Action action) // Action is your own interface with one method, for ex. see ActionListener interface
   - stop()

4. Write synchronous chat between two machines (use ServerSocket and Socket)
