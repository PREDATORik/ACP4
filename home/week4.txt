1. Java standard Serialization
    Threads in java(sleep, join)
    discover classes (Thread, Runnable)
    synchronizations blocks and methods (wait, notify, notifyAll)
    ExecutorService (ThreadPool), interfaces Lock, Condition in package java.util.concurrent
    class Properties

    pattern Observer

2. Find file in file system using threads for faster results
       file paths which have been found, save into one file results.txt

3. Implement asynchronous chat that allows communication with two and more users
    Must have
    - saving history of messages and save all non-standard situations
    - read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
        from server_settings.properties (see class Properties)
    - send message using Serialization
    - for better architecture of application see pattern Observer
    - don't forget about Swing
